# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Vault

This is an vault add-on for Home Assistant. Secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets, and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "Vault" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Vault" add-on to see it in action.

## Configuration


Vault add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
root_tooken: 'myrootpassword'
```

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the add-on and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `certfile`

Sets certificate file.

### Option: `keyfile`

Sets keyfile.

### Option: `root_tooken`

Sets a string as default root tocken to access.
